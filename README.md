# TSST
TSST: A Novel Interpretable Method for Prompt Classification of Time Series

In this repository, you can find all the Python implementations of the algorithms described in the paper and the dataset for which the TSST has been tested.

To reproduce the results published in our paper, you just need to download the whole repository and run the TSST.ipynb. You can choose one of the 13 datasets in each run that can be changed in the ETL part of the notebook.

Of course, you can test TSST on all the Univariate time series datasets of your choice, and I would be happy to hear your comments.
